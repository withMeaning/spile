Contains both spile (the recommender) and the node for communicating content to other spile's & other rss feed consumers.

To run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
`rm spile.db; GLOBAL_AUTH_TOKEN=zaza python3 main.py`

You can test the database creation with
`python3 tests.py`

withmeaning uses a similar data structure to nostr: there is only one, the event.

``` json
{
    "events": [
        {
            "id": "uuid",
            "title?": "Title",
            "author": "name of creator (username, twitter handle, pubkey)",
            "content": "Markdown of main content, number if type resonance",
            "summary?": "AI or human generated summary of content",
            "link?": "url to external website, or id (or identifier) of event if type feedback, recommends, resonance, archive, done",
            "type": "see, read, watch, do, answer, _feedback, recommends _resonance, _archive, _done)",
            "created_at": 1679940469,
        },
    ]
}
```

Types tell the front-end how to display events, `_` types are not displayed, but add metadata to other events

`see` for short tweet-like information or direct messages that are of no other type (nostr kind:1)
`read` for longform articles (from RSS, nostr kind:30023)
`watch` for videos
`do` for executable tasks
`answer` for direct messages / mails that ask questions
`_feedback` internal text-based feedback to the algorithm, can be exposed as a quote tweet, by sending a secand "recommends" event
`recommends` quote tweet with a link to the original event, a quote as content, and the author as the recommender
`_resonance` content must be integer between 0 - 100, user generated by how meaningful an event was. 
`_archive` archives the event if content 1, unarchives if content 0 (exposed on db query, not exposed to spile)
`_done` marks messages as done for events of type "do", if 1. Undo if 0

There will be more types over time, especially ones that extend `do`.

Clients SHOULD display only the latest event if author, type and identifier match.
